# 2nd-Project-Oldenhook
A 2004 Facebook look-a-like webpage built by me during the first month of learning HTML & CSS.

## Screenshots

I built the home-page using inspiration from the 2004 Facebook webpage, back when it was only available for Harvard students. I chose red for the main color and used a different Al Pacino face as the logo, just like in the oldschool Facebook.
